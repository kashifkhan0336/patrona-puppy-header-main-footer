              The Drever's most noticeable characteristic are its long body and
              short legs, inherited from the Westphalian Dachsbracke, but as a
              working dog these features are not exaggerated. It has short fur,
              and is of any color with white markings (but not all white, which
              has been linked to deafness.) The breed has the typical drop
              (hanging) ears of a hound, and a long tail. The maximum height of
              a Drever is 38 cm (15 ins) at the withers, which is about 15 cm
              (approx. 6 ins) shorter than a long legged hunting hound with the
              same size body. The Westphalian Dachsbracke is about 2 cm (less
              than an inch) shorter than the Drever. Alert, calm, friendly and
              even, the Drever is known for the ongoing slight wag of his tail.
              The Drever often wants to continue working long after its human
              companion has satisfied his own hunting instinct. It has a
              first-class nose and is a powerful tracker. Because of its short
              legs, it is slower than other hounds. This makes it ideal for
              maneuvering game toward the hunter's gun. The Drever is a steady
              worker that hunts hare, fox, and occasionally deer; but this dog
              has the courage to pit himself against even a wild boar. In such
              cases, he circles and dodges the prey, warning the hunter by
              barking furiously. The Drever has an excellent nose and a musical
              voice which is much larger than his size would seem to warrant.
              The Drever was bred to be tenacious on the hunt and therefore it
              is very important that the owners of this breed are just as stern
              when dealing with him in order to show him where his place is
              among his human pack. Owners who are determined and consistent
              with the rules, displaying a natural firm but not harsh authority
              over the dog will bring out the best in this breed. Passive owners
              will find the dog to become stubborn and headstrong. Drevers that
              lack in mental and physical exercise and/or leadership will
              develop quirks in their temperament. Socialize this dog well.

              Small sized German hounds were imported to Sweden in 1910. These
              dogs gained a reputation as very good deer trackers. In 1947, the
              larger variety of these dogs was given the name Drever, and it was
              soon recognized as a Swedish breed. They are considered the first
              choice breed for deer tracking but are also used for hunting hare
              and fox. The Drever was recognized by the United Kennel Club
              January 1, 1996.
